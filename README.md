# Income-Classifier-System

### Problem Statement:
<ul>
    <li>Subsidy Inc. delivers subsidies to individuals based on
        their income.</li>
    <li>Accurate income data is one of the hardest piece of data
        to obtain across the world.</li>
    <li>Subsidy Inc. has obtained a large data set of
authenticated data on individual income, demographic
        parameters, and a few financial parameters.</li>
    <li>Subsidy Inc. wishes us to:
Develop an income classifier system for individuals.</li>
    
</ul>

### The Objective is to:
<h6>Simplify the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studied, without sacrificing too much. Such a system would help Subsidy Inc. in planning subsidy outlay, monitoring and preventing misuse.</h6>
